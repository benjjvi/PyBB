# PyBB

An open source bulletin board, designed to run on the lowest end hardware.

## Getting started with an example database.
### Step 1: Creating the database.
PyBB comes with an "example" database mode, that can be found by running "reset.sh" in a terminal. This will create the file "bb.db3" in the "db" folder. Feel free to poke around with a SQLite viewer, and take a look at the tables and values.

### Step 2: Modifying the configuration.
- TODO: Configuration files do not actually do anything, yet.
- TODO: Because configuration files do not do anything, we don't have a configure.sh file.

Taking a look at the configuration file can be a bit daunting, especially with some of the large values. That's why we have a small terminal program that can be run to create the configuration file for you! pybb.conf will be automatically generated at the time of creating the example database, if you are using the example data. Or, you can run the file named "configure.sh", and run through all of the steps there.

### Step 3: Running your server!
- TODO: run.sh uses the insecure built in flask run app. We need to promote this to a proper WGSI interface. DO NOT deploy this bulletin board under any circumstances.
- TODO: Ports cannot be modified. The program will always run on port 5000.
- TODO: HTTPS certificates are not yet supported.

Congratulations. After this short setup, you're ready to get your server started.
Just pop on over to your web browser, and input the IP of the machine you are connecting to (or DNS domain, if the server has been port-forwarded properly), as well as the port (which is not needed if you are using the default HTTP port with http://, or the default HTTPS port with https://).

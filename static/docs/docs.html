    <h1>Welcome to PyBB.</h1>
    <p>This documentation page is not meant to be pretty, because it's not meant to be seen.

Please follow the instructions below to get your bulletin board set up.</p>

    <h2>Part 1 - Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To get started with PyBB is super simple! Run python3 configure.py in your terminal where the main project file is located, and you're done! Just follow the instructions provided there.</p>
